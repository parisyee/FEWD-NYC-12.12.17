# FEWD Final Project Guidelines

## Project Submission

To submit your final project code and components, create a new Github repository. You can name it whatever you'd like, just be sure to send Paris a link to your repo.

#### Due Tuesday, 01/23/18 - Proposal and Wireframes

- Create a `README.md` file in the root of your final project repo. Include a brief description of your project - what it is, why your are interested in building it, etc.

- Create a directory in the root of your project repo called `wireframes`. Add your initial wireframe images to this directory and then commit push them up to Github for review. If your wireframes are hand-drawn, you can scan them or take pictures. Just make sure they are clearly legible and are formatted as either PNG or JPG.

#### Due Tuesday, 02/06/18 - HTML and CSS First Draft

This is the first draft of the HTML and CSS code for your website. You should attempt to get all of the major elements in place and have all non-javascript functionality accounted for.

Please note that fine tuning of styles is not the primary focus of this milestone. Just get your structure in place and throw together a rough idea of styling. You don't want to spend time getting things pixel perfect this early in the game because chances are you will have to change things later on.

**Requirements**

- `index.html` - the homepage of your site. This file should be in the root of your project directory.

- `css` directory - in the root of your project folder. All of your CSS files should be located here.

- `reset.css` - include all of the reset styles (overwriting default browser styles) in a separate reset.css file as to not clutter your actual styles.

- Other HTML pages - although your final project can be a single page website, you may find that you want to add more pages. These other pages can either be in the root of your project directory along with you `index.html` or they can be in a subdirectory.

- Images - if required, please place these in an `images` or `img` directory in the root of your project directory.

- Enable Github pages for your repo to deploy your site for progress review.

- Include the url of your deployed site in the README of your project.

#### Due Tuesday, 02/20/18 - Javascript First Draft

Now that you have most of your HTML and CSS, it's time to add some flourishes with Javascript.

**Requirements**

- `js` or `javascript` directory - in the root of your project repository. This is where all of your Javascript files will go.

- `index.js` - at the minimum, you should have an `index.js` file for your Javascript code. Feel free to create as many Javascript files as you want for organizational purposes.

> You are permitted to use any Javascript library you wish. However, you are not required to use any libraries. The use or nonuse of libraries will not affect your final project grade.

#### Due Thursday, 03/01/18 - Final Project Presentation

On our last day of class, we will be presenting out final projects to each other.

**Requirements**

- Functioning and deployed web site - Your website must be bug free and accessible via a public URL (hosted on GitHub Pages).

- Oral Presentation - During your oral presentation, you will demo your website features to the class. Be prepared to speak about challenges you faces, how you over came them, and your greatest learning moments through the process.

## Grading

Grades will be posted as a GitHub issue ticket on your project repository. The grading process can take up to two weeks (14 days) _after_ your final day of class.
